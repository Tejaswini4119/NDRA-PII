NDRA-PIINDRA-PII
Executive Overview
NDRA-PII represents a paradigm shift in how organizations approach Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII) detection and governance.
Unlike traditional pattern-matching systems, NDRA-PII employs advanced neuro-semantic reasoning to understand context, infer implicit
identities, and provide explainable, policy-driven protection for sensitive data across diverse document types and formats.
Core Innovation: NDRA-PII treats identity as a semantic intelligence problem, combining Microsoft Presidio's robust detection
engine with multi-agent AI orchestration, distributed vector stores, and neuro-symbolic reasoning to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and explainability in PII governance.
System Architecture
NDRA-PII is built on a microkernel-based, multi-agent architecture where specialized agents collaborate through message-passing to achieve
comprehensive PII intelligence. The system operates across eight distinct architectural layers:

" I d e n t i t y  r i s k  e m e r g e s  f r o m  m e a n i n g , n o t  p a t t e r n s "
🎯  Dynamic Risk Scoring
Calculates real-time risk scores (0-
100) based on PII density, exposure
context, jurisdictional requirements,
and historical patterns.
🔐  Policy Enforcement
Supports GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS,
DPDP (India), and custom
organizational policies with
automated redaction and escalation
workﬂows.
📊  Full Explainability
Provides line-level highlights,
decision timelines, clause traceability,
and cryptographically signed audit
trails for compliance.
Multi-Agent System
NDRA-PII employs specialized agents, each with strictly limited authority and clear responsibilities. All inter-agent communication occurs
through secure message queues with comprehensive logging.
Preprocessing Agent
Performs OCR, layout extraction, and semantic-aware chunking with coordinate mapping for provenance.
Embedding Agent
Dynamically selects optimal embedding models (MiniLM/LegalBERT/BioBERT) based on document domain and vectorizes content for
retrieval.
Retrieval Agent
Executes hybrid BM25 + dense vector search with reranking to identify contextually relevant document sections.
PII Extractor Agent
Integrates Presidio AnalyzerEngine with custom recognizers for jurisdiction-speciﬁc IDs (Aadhaar, PAN, passport, etc.).
PII Fusion Agent
Merges detections from Presidio, NER models, and LLM inference while deduplicating overlapping spans.
NSRL Reasoner Agent
Applies compiled policy rules using a deterministic engine with LLM fallback for ambiguous cases.
Risk Analyzer Agent
Computes multi-dimensional risk scores using heuristics and ML ensemble models.
Redaction Agent
Leverages Presidio AnonymizerEngine to mask, hash, or tokenize sensitive information per policy.
Explainability Agent
Constructs decision timelines, highlights source evidence, and generates human-readable justiﬁcations.
Test Generator Agent
Automatically synthesizes positive/negative test cases from policy rules for continuous validation.
Microsoft Presidio Integration
NDRA-PII deeply integrates Microsoft Presidio as its foundational PII detection layer, dramatically reducing development complexity while
ensuring production-grade accuracy:
Built-in Recognizers
Aadhaar PAN Passport Credit Cards Email Addresses Phone Numbers IP Addresses
Bank Accounts Names Addresses SSN (US) Medical IDs
Anonymization Strategies
Presidio's AnonymizerEngine supports multiple strategies: redact (complete removal), mask (XXX-XX-1234), hash (SHA-256/HMAC), encrypt
(reversible tokenization), and replace (synthetic data substitution). NDRA-PII selects strategies dynamically based on document type,
sensitivity level, and organizational policy.
Neuro-Symbolic Rule Layer (NSRL)
NSRL combines the precision of symbolic logic with the ﬂexibility of neural inference. Rules are authored in a human-readable DSL and
compiled to executable forms:
rule_id: R_HIGH_RISK_AADHAAR priority: 100 description: "Aadhaar in contract triggers escalation" when: -
pii.subtype == "aadhaar" - doc.type == "contract" - doc.metadata.policy_age_months < 6 then: - severity:
high - action: redact_and_escalate - notification: security_ops - retention_override: 7_years
The NSRL engine evaluates deterministic rules ﬁrst, falling back to LLM-based interpretation for ambiguous cases. All rule ﬁrings are logged
with cryptographic signatures for audit purposes.

Can Google Antigravity Do my NDRA? 
Context : 
Neuro-Semantic Document Research Assistance (NDRA)
“NDRA: Neuro-semantic intelligence to interpret large unstructured 
documents.”
NDRA (Neuro-Semantic Document Research Assistance) is a 
semantic, transformer-based retrieval and reasoning system 
designed to extract structured knowledge from large, unstructured 
textual documents such as insurance policies, legal contracts, and 
corporate communications. It leverages Domain-Adapted 
Embedding Models, Contextual Chunking Strategies, and Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipelines to align vague or under-
speciﬁed user queries with document clauses, enabling high-
ﬁdelity question answering and policy decision support.
Objective
To build a robust system capable of:
Understanding vague user queries like:
“46-year-old male, knee surgery in Pune, 3-month-old policy”
Extracting structured data: age, procedure, gender, location, 
duration
Mapping those ﬁelds to relevant policy clauses
Evaluating eligibility logic from the document
Producing a structured JSON response that includes:
Approval or rejection
Eligible amount (if any)
Clause-level justiﬁcation for the decision
System Architecture Overview
NDRA follows a modular, phase-based pipeline for ai-core divided 
into four major components:

Thought for 8s
Short answer: Yes — Google Antigravity can strongly accelerate building and prototyping
NDRA, but it won’t magically be a production NDRA out of the box. It’s an excellent agent-
ﬁrst IDE for orchestrating the work (generate code, run tests, iterate agents, produce artifacts and
screenshots), but you should treat it as a very fast prototyping and engineering assistant that you
then harden, secure, and deploy to your own infra (Kubernetes, Chroma, managed LLMs, etc.).
Below I’ll outline why it’s a ﬁt, risks/limitations, and a concrete antigravity-ﬁrst plan you can
run immediately to implement NDRA’s modules.
Why Antigravity is a good match
Agent orchestration — Antigravity is designed to run multiple autonomous agents (Agent
Manager) that can plan, do work (edit ﬁles, run commands, browse), and produce veriﬁable
artifacts. That matches NDRA’s multi-module work (preprocessing agent, embedding agent, RAG
agent, API agent). 
Built-in Gemini / LLM integration — It ships with Gemini 3 Pro (and can use other models) so
you can prototype Query Understanding, intent-mapping, and RAG prompt orchestration inside
the IDE. 
Artifacts & traceability — Antigravity records “Artifacts” (plans, screenshots, browser
recordings) which helps for clause-traceability, audit trails and demo material for judges.
Browser automation & testing — Agents can test UI endpoints and run integration checks,
useful to validate FastAPI endpoints or RAG pipeline behaviors. 
Important limits & risks (so you don’t get burned)
Not a secure production runtime. Antigravity is ideal for prototyping and iterating, not for
storing sensitive production docs or keys. Move production vector stores / PII into your controlled
infra.
Agent autonomy hazards. There are documented incidents where aggressive agent actions
caused destructive system-level commands — require strict sandboxing, CI checks, and least
privilege for any agent that runs shell/FS ops. (Implement dry-run and manual approval gates for
destructive steps). 
Rate limits / quotas may apply for heavy automated usage; plan for model billing or quotas if
you scale. 
Vendor lock / compliance if you put the entire pipeline in Google-managed stack — plan
exportable artifacts and self-hosted fallbacks (your Chroma DB, self-hosted LLMs or OpenRouter)
for audit/compliance.

You can start with Antigravity to produce a working NDRA prototype in iterative sprints. Each bullet is
a mission (agent job) you can create in Antigravity Agent Manager.
1. Mission: Ingest & Preprocess (Preprocessing Agent)
Tasks: accept PDF/DOCX/EML, run semantic-aware chunker, remove headers/footers, produce
`chunks.pkl` and sample chunk metadata (source page, oﬀsets).
Deliverables (Artifact): `chunks.pkl`, sample cleaned text, unit tests.
Use Antigravity to run the parser locally, iterate on edge-cases, collect screenshots/logs.
2. Mission: Embeddings & Vector Store (Embedding Agent)
Tasks: call sentence-transformers (or a hosted embedding model), generate vectors, upsert to
Chroma (or your chosen store). Save mapping `chunk_id -> source metadata`.
Deliverable: working vector-index and a queryable local endpoint.
3. Mission: Query Understanding (LLM Agent / Intent Cleaner)
Tasks: take raw user text (vague queries), rewrite to structured JSON with ﬁelds (age, gender,
procedure, location, policy-age) and mark missing/ambiguous ﬁelds. Use few-shot examples.
Deliverable: structured JSON schema + conﬁdence score + fallback prompts for missing
ﬁelds.
4. Mission: Retrieval & RAG (RAG Agent)
Tasks: run top-K semantic search, assemble context windows (respecting token limit), craft
RAG prompt for decision logic (approval/rejection, eligible amount, clause citations). Chain
LLM calls: one for evidence extraction, one for eligibility logic.
Deliverable: JSON response with `decision`, `eligible_amount`, `clauses[]` with source refs.
5. Mission: Decision Engine & Edge Cases (Rules Agent)
Tasks: implement deterministic rules (conﬂict detection, thresholding, numeric calculations) in
code that wraps LLM outputs; create canary tests for typical and edge-case policies.
6. Mission: API & UI (API Agent + UI Agent)
Tasks: generate FastAPI endpoints for `upload`, `query`, `result`; Streamlit UI to upload
documents and show structured JSON with clause highlights. Agents can auto-generate unit
tests and sample datasets.
7. Mission: CI / Safety & Canary (Ops Agent)
Tasks: create preﬂight checks, sandbox policy to block destructive commands, rate-limit LLM-
driven runs, ensure logs/artifacts are stored externally (S3/GCS) for audit.
Example Agent Prompt (starter)
You can paste this into an Antigravity agent to get going (tweak as needed):
csharp
Mission: Preprocess uploaded insurance PDF into semantic chunks.
Steps:
1. Extract plain text from PDF (preserve page numbers).
2. Remove headers/footers and OCR noise.
Copy code
🎯  Made by www .chatgpt2pdf .net 7 / 184
How I recommend you use Antigravity in practice
Prototype inside Antigravity: let agents scaﬀold the code, tests, and RAG prompts quickly. Use
Artifacts for demo and traceability. 
Extract & Harden: export the generated code/artifacts and run them in your own CI/k8s cluster.
Replace any hosted vector or LLM components with your chosen production services (self-hosted
Chroma, OpenRouter+FastLLM or managed Google Vertex AI depending on constraints).
Strict sandboxing: in Antigravity, restrict agents to a dev container/micro-VM and require
manual approvals for destructive tasks. Keep production keys out of the preview workspace.
Quick timeline for a hackathon MVP (using Antigravity)
Day 0: Set up Antigravity, import one sample policy doc (use codelab to onboard). 
Day 1: Build Preprocessing & Embedding missions, get Chroma up and a simple vector search.
Day 2: Build Query Understanding agent + RAG prompt that outputs JSON. Validate with 10
queries.
Day 3: FastAPI + Streamlit UI agent, demo ﬂow with clause traceability.
Day 4: Polish artifacts, add deterministic rule engine, prepare presentation.
Want me to do one of these now?
I can (pick one and I’ll produce it now) (no waiting needed):
scaﬀold the FastAPI + chunking + embedding code (starter repo layout + key ﬁles), or
write the Query→Structured-JSON LLM prompt and few-shot examples you can drop into
Antigravity, or
generate the Antigravity Mission plan with step-by-step agent prompts for each NDRA module
(Preprocess, Embeddings, RAG, API, CI).
Tell me which one you want me to produce right now and I’ll generate it (code, prompts, or mission
sheet) — I won’t ask you to wait.
3. Perform semantic-aware chunking: split at clause boundaries (~400–800 tokens), attach 
metadata: {doc_id, page, chunk_id, char_start, char_end}.
4. Save output to /workspace/chunks/chunks.pkl and produce sample JSON file with 5 chunks.
Return: artifacts (chunks.pkl), logs, and one test case demonstrating clause-level mapping.

How new features can be added? Any new features? Ideas? 
Here are powerful, realistic new features you can add to NDRA — including several next-
generation ones that transform it from a semantic RAG engine into a full neuro-symbolic policy
🎯  Made by www .chatgpt2pdf .net 8 / 184
reasoning system.
I grouped them into New Feature Categories + Actual Feature Ideas under each.
1. Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Layer (NSRL)
This is the next major evolution of NDRA.
You combine:
LLM semantic interpretation
With symbolic rule engines (Prolog, Python rulesets, or Decision Trees)
Features:
🧠  1.1 Clause-to-Logic Compiler
NDRA automatically converts policy clauses → machine-executable rules.
Example:
“Waiting period for knee surgery is 2 years” →
`if procedure == "knee_surgery" and policy_age < 24 months: reject("waiting_period")`
🧩  1.2 Conﬂict Resolver
Detects contradictory clauses in policy documents and resolves via priority rules:
Newer clause wins
More speciﬁc clause wins
⚖  1.3 Hybrid Reasoner
Semantic LLM + symbolic rules run together and cross-verify.
This massively boosts accuracy for insurance/legal decisions.
2. Document Intelligence & Auto-Mapping Layer
Let NDRA understand any document format — even mixed or messy ones.
📄  2.1 Layout-Aware Understanding
Use LayoutLMv3 / Donut models to understand:
Tables
Footnotes
Numbered clauses
Markups
Highlighted text
🎯  Made by www .chatgpt2pdf .net 9 / 184
Forms
🔗  2.2 Auto-Policy Mapping
NDRA automatically identiﬁes types of documents:
Health Policy
Motor Policy
Travel Insurance
Home Insurance
Legal Contracts
This enables multi-domain NDRA.
🧬  2.3 Ontology Builder (Automatic Insurance Glossary)
NDRA builds a knowledge graph of:
diseases
procedures
exclusions
waiting periods
claim types
coverage items
This allows zero-shot reasoning for new queries.
3. Advanced Query Understanding
Make NDRA feel like a real human insurance expert.
🔍  3.1 Query Ambiguity Resolver
If user writes:
“Policy 3 months old, surgery in Pune, 46-year-old male.”
But doesn’t specify the surgery type,
NDRA replies:
“Do you mean: Knee surgery / Hip replacement / General surgery?”
with semantic guesses.
🎭  3.2 Persona-Based Reasoning
NDRA can answer according to diﬀerent proﬁles:
Strict IRDAI compliance mode
Relaxed customer support mode

If location is missing → deduce from context
If policy type is unknown → detect from vocabulary
4. Trust, Safety, and Explainability Upgrades
Transform NDRA into an auditable system suitable for enterprise.
📌  4.1 Line-Level Justiﬁcation Map
NDRA highlights exact lines inside the PDF that caused:
rejection
approval
partial approval
🎞  4.2 Decision Timeline Playback
A visual replay of how NDRA:
1. Read the document
2. Retrieved relevant clauses
3. Applied logic
4. Arrived at the ﬁnal JSON decision
🔐  4.3 Blockchain-based Decision Ledger (optional)
Each decision saved as an immutable event.
Useful for audits.
5. Speed, Eﬃciency & Multi-Agent Architecture
Inspired by your REVA4 + AADS projects.
🚀  5.1 Multi-Agent NDRA Swarm
Specialized agents:
Preprocessing Agent
Embedding Agent
🎯  Made by www .chatgpt2pdf .net 11 / 184
Retrieval Agent
Eligibility Logic Agent
Final Decision Agent
Conﬂict Resolution Agent
They work in parallel for <5s response times.
⚙  5.2 Dynamic Embedding Selection
Choose embedding model based on query type:
Medical queries → BioBERT embeddings
Legal queries → LegalBERT
General → MiniLM
🌐  5.3 Distributed Vector Store
Sharded Chroma for huge enterprise-level policies (>1000 pages).
6. Enterprise-Grade Extensions
Features that turn NDRA into a commercial SaaS.
📊  6.1 Analytics Dashboard

decision heatmaps
denial reasons
fraud ﬂags
🛂  6.2 User Role System
Admin
Underwriter
Manager
Customer Support
Claims Auditor
📥  6.3 Automated Email Ingestion
NDRA reads email chains → extracts:
disputes
attachments
policy details
🎯  Made by www .chatgpt2pdf .net 12 / 184
medical info
And processes automatically.
7. Fraud, Anomaly & Risk Detection Layer
Add predictive ML components.
🧿  7.1 Medical Fraud Pattern Detection
Flag high-risk patterns:
very new policy + expensive procedure
mismatch between procedure and diagnosis
repeated claims across hospitals
📉  7.2 Claim Risk Score
Give a numeric risk score (0–100).
👮  7.3 Hospital/Doctor Reputation Mapping
Based on external data (future expansion).
8. Multimodal NDRA
Take NDRA beyond text.
🖼  8.1 Image & Document OCR Integration
User uploads:
discharge summary
bill photos
handwritten notes
NDRA extracts medical entities + maps them to policy clauses.
💬  8.2 Voice Query Understanding
User speaks vague question → NDRA structures it.
9. Auto-Test Generation & Policy Validation
This is extremely useful for enterprises.
🎯  Made by www .chatgpt2pdf .net 13 / 184
🧪  9.1 Auto-Generate Test Cases
NDRA produces its own test suite for every policy uploaded.
🧭  9.2 Clause Drift Detector
If a company updates its policy, NDRA detects diﬀerences:
Added clauses
Removed coverage
Changed exclusions
This is huge for insurance companies.
10. NDRA 2.0 — "Universal Document Brain"
Your future vision could be:
NDRA should not only answer queries…
It should understand, validate, rewrite, optimize, and structure entire documents.
Features:
Rewrite outdated policies
Suggest improvements
Auto-translate policies
Auto-summarize ﬁnancial/legal docs
Convert unstructured docs → structured knowledge base

Craft New NDRA.   
  
Multi Agent NDRA Swarm + Dynamic Embeddings + Distributed 
Vector Store + Enterprise-Grade Extensions + Fraud/Anomaly Risk 
Detection Layers + MultiModel NDRA + AutoTest / Policy Validation 
+ Trust/Safety/Explainability Upgrades + AQU + Document 
Intelligence + NSRL  
  
Thought for a couple of seconds
Nice — let’s craft “New NDRA”: a production-ready, multi-agent, neuro-symbolic, multimodal
Document Research Assistance platform with swarming agents, dynamic embeddings, distributed
vector storage, enterprise features, fraud/risk layers, explainability, auto-testing, and a clause→logic
compiler. I’ll give you: architecture, components, data ﬂows, agent deﬁnitions & prompts, APIs &
schemas, tech stack, implementation roadmap + milestones, testing & observability, example
outputs, and security/compliance guidance. No hand-waving — everything here you can drop into
sprints or into Antigravity agents to prototype immediately.
1 — High-level summary (one sentence)
New NDRA = a multi-agent swarm that ingests multimodal documents, selects the optimal
embedding & retrieval path per query, runs a hybrid LLM + symbolic reasoning decision
pipeline, produces auditable JSON decisions with clause-level citations, detects fraud/risk,
auto-generates tests, and exposes enterprise APIs + dashboards.
2 — Top-level architecture (textual diagram)
Clients (UI / API / Email / Voice)
→ API Gateway / Auth (OIDC / SSO)
→ Ingestion Layer (Upload Worker, Email Harvester, OCR Worker)
→ Preprocessing & Chunker (Layout-aware chunker; OCR → tokens → semantic chunks)
→ Chunks Store + Metadata DB (Postgres / Neo4j for KG)
→ Embedding Router (Dynamic Embedding Selector)
→ Distributed Vector Store (sharded Chroma / Milvus / Pinecone hybrid)
→ Multi-Agent Orchestrator (Swarm)
Preprocessor Agent
Embedding Agent
Retrieval Agent
Query Understanding Agent
Reasoning Agent (LLM + Rule Engine)
Fraud/Anomaly Agent
