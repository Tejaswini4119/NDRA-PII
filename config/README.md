# Configuration

This directory holds the configuration files for the NDRA-PII system.

## Files

- **`settings.py`**: Pydantic-based configuration management. Defines paths (uploads, artifacts), API keys, and environment variables.
- **`ndra-pii.antigravity.yml`**: High-level system architecture and rigorous constraint definitions (e.g., "fail_closed_on_uncertainty", "raw_pii_allowed: false").
