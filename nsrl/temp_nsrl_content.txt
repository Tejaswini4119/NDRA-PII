NEURO-SEMANTIC RULE LANGUAGE 
NSRL (Neuro -Semantic Rule Language) is a purpose -built, human -authored, domain -
specific policy language used within NDRA-PII to deterministically interpret the meaning, 
sensitivity, and compliance implications of detected Personally Identifiable Information. 
It acts as the formal bridge between low -level PII detection outputs and high -level 
governance decisions by encoding legal, regulatory, and organizational intent into a 
constrained, executable rule system. NSRL exists to ensure that decisions about 
sensitive data are made through explicit human logic rather than implicit or probabilistic 
AI behavior. 
NSRL is designed to operate strictly on structured, verified inputs produced by upstream 
systems, such as PII objects extracted by Microsoft Presidio, document metadata 
generated by document intelligence pipelines, and contextual attributes like jurisdiction, 
channel, and document type. It never processes raw text and never performs inference. 
Instead, it evaluates declarative conditions against already-detected facts, ensuring that 
interpretation remains grounded in deterministic evidence rather than lingu istic 
ambiguity. 
The language is intentionally limited in expressiveness. NSRL is not a programming 
language and cannot perform computation, iteration, state mutation, or external calls. 
This restriction is deliberate and fundamental to its safety model. By limiting what can be 
expressed, NSRL prevents hidden logic, unintended side effects, and unsafe policy 
behavior. Every rule written in NSRL is transparent, bounded, and auditable, making the 
system suitable for regulated environments where explainability and repeatabilit y are 
mandatory. 
Execution of NSRL rules is fully deterministic. Given the same inputs, the same rules will 
always fire in the same way and produce the same interpretive outputs. Multiple rules 
may apply simultaneously, and conflicts are resolved through explicitly defined  
precedence semantics rather than heuristic resolution. This guarantees consistency 
across runs, environments, and deployments, eliminating nondeterministic behavior 
that would otherwise undermine trust and compliance. 
NSRL does not make final decisions or perform actions such as redaction or blocking. 
Instead, it produces structured interpretive signals including severity classifications, 
compliance flags, escalation indicators, and human -readable justifications. These 
outputs are consumed by downstream decision and enforcement layers, which remain 
separate from policy interpretation. This separation ensures that NSRL governs meaning, 
while other components govern execution. 
Explainability is a first-class property of NSRL. Every rule execution produces a complete 
trace describing which rule fired, which conditions matched, what data was evaluated, 
and why a particular outcome was produced. This trace is preserved as part of t he 
system’s audit record and can be reviewed by engineers, compliance teams, auditors, or 
regulators. There is no hidden reasoning path or opaque decision logic. 
All NSRL rules, semantics, invariants, and constraints are authored and controlled 
exclusively by human Semantic Intelligence Engineers. NSRL is treated as codified legal 
and compliance intent rather than configuration or code. As such, it is versioned, 
reviewed, approved, and governed through explicit human processes. Automated 
systems, including AI-based tools, are not permitted to author, modify, or evolve NSRL 
rules. This ensures that accountability for policy decisions always remains human and 
defensible. 
In the broader NDRA -PII architecture, NSRL functions as the safety and governance 
boundary that prevents intelligent systems from overreaching. While AI components may 
assist in detection, enrichment, or explanation, NSRL defines the authoritative limits o f 
interpretation and enforcement. By constraining intelligence within a human-defined rule 
language, NDRA -PII achieves a balance between automation and control, enabling 
scalable privacy intelligence without sacrificing determinism, trust, or compliance. 
In essence, NSRL is the formal mechanism by which NDRA -PII transforms detected 
personal data into legally meaningful, explainable, and auditable policy outcomes. It is 
the reason NDRA -PII can be fast and intelligent while remaining safe, predictable, and 
regulator-grade.
